Emacs Configuration file 
========================

This emacs conf. file is based on Cask & Pallet.
You can follow the instruction on [cask](http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to install Cask properly.
Once that  done, you  only have  to make  sure the  first line  of the
init.el file pointed to the right file.
